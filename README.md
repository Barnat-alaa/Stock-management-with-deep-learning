This project utilizes open-source code from TensorFlow, which incorporates various deep learning techniques such as dense neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN),
recurrent neural networks (RNN), and autoregressive RNN models for weather predictions. 

I have modified and enhanced this code to cater specifically to stock management issues, adding functionalities such as automatic model selection based on comparison. 

The purpose of this project is to assist DTP Mining, a division of Bouygues Construction, in accurately estimating the consumption of all components in the rolling chain of D9. 
Furthermore, this project can be easily adapted to estimate the monthly consumption of any parts on any model.
